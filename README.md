# Dojo-Challenges
Swift Takeover Dojo challenges in Playgrounds format

Each challenge is a Swift [Playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=35). Simply open the Playground of your choice in Xcode and follow the challenge information in the playground file.

You will be given one function that you must implement. The file might have tests that you can use to verify your solution.

The playground might not compile at first. That's fine. You'll need to fill in the body of the function to get it to compile.

## Sharing Solutions
At the end of the challenge, you will get the most benefit by sharing your solution with others and by observing their solutions. There are a few ways to do this, depending on the situation.

#### Slack
If you are on the Swift Takeover Slack group, share your solution in the #solutions channel.

#### Pull Request
Fork the repository and make a pull request with the completed challenge. It won't get merged, but not to worry! Your solution will be up on your Github profile for the world to see.

## Trials
The challenge might have optional *Trials* that make the challenge easier or harder to solve. For example, in the Spell It To Me challenge:

One of the trials is to handle capitalisation.

If you don't want to face the trial, simply comment out the test.

## Rendered Markup
Xcode should show markup text in the playground files. If you see raw markup like this:

In Xcode, choose *Editor > Show Rendered Markup*. If you only see *Editor > Show Raw Markup*, choose that first and then choose *Show Rendered Markup*.
